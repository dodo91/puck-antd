# Puck + Ant Design Builder

A simple React app that uses [`@measured/puck`](https://github.com/measuredco/puck) with Ant Design components to build layouts via drag and drop. The editor ships with reusable components for buttons, forms, form items, and tables.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Drag components from the left panel into the canvas.
- Form items are designed to be placed inside a Form component.
- Table content uses sample data to demonstrate layout.
